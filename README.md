# JavaForPiExamples
In this project you can find all the sources and scripts described in the book ["Getting started with Java on the Raspberry Pi" available on Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/gettingstartedwithjavaontheraspberrypi/).

## Content
Everything is organized according to the chapters in the book.

Within each chapter you will find (but not always all of them):
* A README file like this on, with more info about the content of the chapter itself.
* One "scripts" directory with scripts e.g. to install Java on the Pi.
* One "schemes" directory with Fritzing files with the wiring of the projects in this chapter.
* One or more "java-..." directories, depending on the content:
	* Only .java-files: code you can run without the need to compile (with Java 11+).
	* A new directory structure with a "pom.xml" in the root: a full Maven Java project.
* One or more "javafx-..." directories: a full Mavan JavaFX project.
